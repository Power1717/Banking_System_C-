Project Name : Banking System Using C++
Language Used : C++
Outcome and Usage : The Banking Management System project in C++ provides a simple yet functional platform for managing bank accounts. Users can open new accounts, perform transactions like deposit and withdrawal, check balances, close accounts, and view account details. The system ensures data persistence by storing account information in a file. It incorporates exception handling for scenarios like insufficient funds during withdrawals. The menu-driven interface allows users to interact with the banking system seamlessly, making it a basic but practical implementation of a banking management system.

some key Components and Classes used in Project are follows:

1. Classes and Header Includes:
The code uses several standard C++ library headers, including <iostream>, <fstream>, <cstdlib>, <vector>, and <map>.
It defines two classes: Account and Bank.

2. Account Class:
The Account class represents an individual bank account.
Private members include accountNumber, firstName, lastName, balance, and a static variable NextAccountNumber.
Public member functions include constructors, getters (getAccNo(), getFirstName(), getLastName(), getBalance()), and methods for deposit and withdrawal (Deposit(), Withdraw()).
The friend keyword is used to declare non-member functions (operator<<, operator>>, operator<<) as friends of the Account class, allowing them to access private members.

3. Bank Class:
The Bank class manages a collection of Account objects using a map<long, Account>.
It includes functions for opening an account (OpenAccount()), checking balance (BalanceEnquiry()), depositing (Deposit()), withdrawing (Withdraw()), closing an account (CloseAccount()), and showing all accounts (ShowAllAccounts()).
The constructor of the Bank class reads account data from a file (Bank.data) and initializes the accounts.
The destructor writes the account data back to the file when the program exits.

4. Main Function:
The main() function is the entry point of the program.
It creates an instance of the Bank class (b) and an instance of the Account class (acc).
It presents a menu to the user, allowing them to perform various banking operations like opening an account, checking balance, depositing, withdrawing, closing an account, showing all accounts, and quitting the program.
User choices are processed through a switch statement.

5. File Handling:
The program reads and writes account data to a file (Bank.data).
Account data is stored in a structured manner, and the file handling is done using the ifstream and ofstream classes.

6. Exception Handling:
An InsufficientFunds exception is defined but not used in the provided code. This exception could be thrown when attempting to withdraw an amount greater than the current balance.

7. Static Variable:
The NextAccountNumber static variable in the Account class is used to assign unique account numbers to each new account created.

8. Looping Menu:
The program runs in a loop until the user chooses to quit.

9. Data Persistence:
Account data is persisted between program runs by storing it in a file.

10. Friend Functions:
Friend functions are used for overloading stream operators (<< and >>) to facilitate input/output operations on Account objects.
